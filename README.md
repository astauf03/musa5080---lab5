## Overview
This project builds a space-time predictive model of hourly bike share demand across Philadelphia’s Indego system.
Using full-year 2024 trip data, weather, and census characteristics, the analysis forecasts demand at the station-hour level and evaluates prediction accuracy across neighborhoods and time periods.

This work demonstrates practical forecasting for real-world mobility operations, with attention to equity, seasonality, and model interpretability.
